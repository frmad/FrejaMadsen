                            Hello, I'm Freja Marie Madsen, a 23-year-old Full Stack IT Developer with a strong passion for web development, design, and personal growth. My journey into technology started with a keen interest in business and IT, leading me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). This education has provided me with a solid foundation in software development, web design, and problem-solving, complemented by valuable experience in customer service.<br/><br/>
                            Throughout my academic career, I have worked with a diverse range of technologies including Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Kotlin, and Python. My experience extends to working with relational databases like PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. I also have hands-on experience with container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, enhancing my understanding of modern development practices.<br/><br/>
                            My studies and projects have involved developing prototypes, designing, and implementing features based on user feedback. I am particularly passionate about creating seamless user experiences through thoughtful design and analysis. Additionally, I am familiar with version control using GitHub, CI/CD practices with GitHub Actions, and hosting with GitHub Pages.<br/><br/>
                            My academic journey includes a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from the University of Southern Denmark, where I combined theoretical knowledge with practical experience in programming, software architecture, and project management. My high school education at Nyborg Gymnasium provided a solid foundation in economics, marketing, and languages.<br/><br/>
                            Beyond my technical skills, I am highly organized and dedicated. My customer-facing roles have refined my communication skills, enabling me to work effectively both independently and as part of a team. I am driven by a strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence in every task I undertake.<br/><br/>
                            I am always eager to explore new areas, enhance my skills, and embrace challenges that foster both personal and professional growth. If you are looking for someone who brings energy, dedication, and a versatile skill set to the table, I would love to connect.<br/><br/>
                            Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to potential opportunities to collaborate.
                        </p>
